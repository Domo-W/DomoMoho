- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dominic! I'm a second year Computer Science student currently at Santa Clara University. I'm mainly looking to use github as a way to store 
my own projects, while also as a way to contribute to other's projects to further my own learning.
I'm currently proficient in C++, C#, Python, HTMl, CSS, and Javascript. In my free time I play the piano and/or electric bass, as well as going hiking.

In case you want to contact me, please email me at: Domo_W@outlook.com
